    "# Using Python for Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Packages\n",
    "+ [`astropy`](http://www.astropy.org/): Includes functions for reading/writing data files (including `.fits`), cosmology calculations, astronomical constants and coordinate systems, image processing, and much more\n",
    "+ [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/): Adds ability to deal with multi-dimensional arrays and vectorized math functions\n",
    "+ [`scipy`](http://www.scipy.org/): Extends `numpy` by adding common scientific functions such as ODE integration, statistical analysis, linear algebra, and FFT\n",
    "+ [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/): A useful plotting package\n",

    "## Installing python\n",
    "The easiest way to install python on any OS is to use [anaconda python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  This will install a local version of python on your system so you don't need to worry about needing admin to install new packages.  Most of the packages listed above are installed by default with anaconda.  For this class we will be using python 3, and I recommend you use this version for you research (unless you have a very good reason to use python 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text editors\n",
    "Although there are numerous IDEs (e.g. IDLE, Spyder) for python, for most everyday use you will likely be writing python code in a text editor and running your programs via the command line.  In this case it is important to have a good text editor that supports syntax highlighting and possibly live linting (syntax and style checking).  I use the [atom](https://atom.io/) text editor, a 'hackable' text editor that offers a large range of add-ons to support your coding style.  If you decide to use atom you will want the following add-ons: `language-python`, `linter`, `linter-python`, and the python packages `pylama` and `pylama-pylint` installed.  As a bonus the atom editor has full support for `git` and `git-hub`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding style\n",
    "When working on code with others, it is helpful to define a coding style for a project.  That way the code is written in a predictable way and it is easy to read.  Many projects use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as a starting point for a style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic syntax examples\n",
    "For a general overview of python's syntax head over to [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and take their interactive tutorial.  In this class we will only be covering what is necessary for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### importing packages\n",
    "Any package or code from another `.py` file can be imported with a simple `import` statement.  By default all imported code has its own name space, so you don't have to worry about overwriting existing functions.  The final line of this code block is a \"magic\" `Jupyter` function needed to make interactive plots inside of `Jupyter notebooks`."
